# Willing Workers Website

Welcome to the Willing Workers website, built using REACT with Typescript. This site is dedicated to assisting and supporting individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Our mission is to promote independence, self-advocacy, and overall well-being through community integration training and the development of healthy habits.

The website features a Google Maps integration to provide information about our organization and programs. You can also learn more about our mission and values, and how we strive to improve the quality of life for the individuals we serve by focusing on areas such as safety, personal health and hygiene, nutrition, physical fitness, and emergency preparedness.

At Willing Workers, we believe in the inherent worth and potential of every individual and are committed to helping those with intellectual and developmental disabilities lead fulfilling and independent lives. We also ensure that individuals at Willing Workers perform to their highest potential and become full participants in their communities.
